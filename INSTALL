To install this library you are going to need latest libavg and latest
Chromium Embedded Framework compiled.

The project uses a cmake build system. It is recommended to use cmake-gui
as you are required to manually set CMAKE paths to libavg and cef directories.

On windows, the usage of the libavg prebuilt dependency package is advised.


The process after having libavg and CEF built is as follows:

run cmake-gui, choose your designated compiler, run configure.

You will probably see a lot of red lines in the cefgui interface.
Every line should have a sensible name, and a tooltip that tells you
what does it want in the given position.

Fill all the red values, then hit configure - Repeat until no red lines appear
and no errors show up in the log.

Hit Generate.

After this you can find project files in your designated binary directory.

All the resource files used by CEF, along with a test python file are included
in the designated release directory.
On unix a copy of your python2.7 is also generated, as its necessary as
otherwise CEF would look for dependencies in /usr/bin/

You can run the test with
"./mypy testapp.py" on unix
"python testapp.py" on windows
